Alya, a hard worker, is working on a project involving Optimal Binary Search Trees (OBSTs). OBSTs are special data structures designed to minimize the average search cost for a given set of keys and their corresponding frequencies.



She is developing a program to find the cost of an Optimal Binary Search Tree for a set of keys and their frequencies. Help her to create a program.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of keys in the existing OBST.

The second line of input consists of n space-separated integers, each representing a unique key K.

The third line of input consists of n space-separated integers, each representing the frequency F of the corresponding key.

Output format :
The output should consist of a single line "Cost of Optimal BST is <optimal BST cost value>" for the given set of keys and frequencies.



Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ K, F ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
10 12 20
34 8 50
Output 1 :
Cost of Optimal BST is 142
