Problem Statement



As a senior software engineer, you have been tasked with developing a program that uses dynamic programming to find the length of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) in a given string.

You need to implement a function to find the longest palindromic subsequence that takes a string as input and returns an integer representing the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string.

Input format :
The input consists of a single line containing a string consisting of the English alphabet.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer representing the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ Length of string ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
madam
Output 1 :
5
Input 2 :
mam
Output 2 :
3
